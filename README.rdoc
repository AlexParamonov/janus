= Janus

Janus is an authentication engine for Ruby on Rails 3 and is an alternative
to the Warden + Devise combo, except there is no Rack middleware.

Janus is a work in progress and even thought it may log users in different
scopes, it doesn't encrypt passwords nor provides automated registration,
confirmation, etc.
